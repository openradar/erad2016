### Welcome to the ERAD 2016 short course on community radar software
This course will take place on October 9th 2016, right before the ERAD 2016 conference. We will introduce the participants to community software packages designed for radar data processing, mainly [BALTRAD](http://git.baltrad.eu/) and [wradlib](http://wradlib.github.io/wradlib-docs). 

These tools can be controlled by using Python, so we'll feature a quick intro to the Python programming language, and endow participants with the basics of how to contribute to community software. For the course, we will provide a [platform-independent virtual machine](http://openradar.github.com) that contains all the required software, data, and course materials.

> *Please note:* We had to slightly adjust the course contents in comparison to the original announcement 
> (see the [course program](#course-program) below). We will not provide in-depth coverage of the 
> [Py-ART](http://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/) package, although we'll feature a quick background. 
> Furthermore, the link to the RQQI meeting was cancelled. 

### Registration 
Register at the [ERAD Short Course page](http://erad2016.org/short-courses/) for *Short Course 1*. A fee of 50 EURO will be charged including luch and coffee breaks. Beware that the maximum number of participants is limited to 30.

### List of tutors
- Crisologo, Irene (University of Potsdam, Germany)
- Heistermann, Maik (University of Potsdam, Germany)
- Michelson, Daniel B. (Environment and Climate Change Canada)

### Things you need to prepare
Participants need to bring their own notebook. All you need to do is to install VirtualBox and import the Virtual Machine for the course. Please see http://openradar.github.io for detailed instructions, but, in time, we will also send around an e-Mail to the registered participants.

### Survey
Please take the time to [participate in our brief survey](https://www.surveymonkey.de/r/XP32W2N). This way, we can get an idea about our common background. We will present the survey results during the course.
