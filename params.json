  "body": "### Welcome to the ERAD 2016 short course on community radar software\r\nThis course will take place on October 9th 2016, right before the ERAD 2016 conference. We will introduce the participants to community software packages designed for radar data processing, mainly [BALTRAD](http://git.baltrad.eu/) and [wradlib](http://wradlib.github.io/wradlib-docs). \r\n\r\nThese tools can be controlled by using Python, so we'll feature a quick intro to the Python programming language, and endow participants with the basics of how to contribute to community software. For the course, we will provide a [platform-independent virtual machine](http://openradar.github.com) that contains all the required software, data and other course materials.\r\n\r\n### Changes in course as compared to the original announcement\r\n\r\nWe had to slightly adjust the course contents in comparison to the original announcement on this page (see also the adjusted curse program below). We will not provide in-depth coverage of the [Py-ART](http://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/) package, although we'll feature a quick background. In addition, the course will not be linked to the \"WMO Radar Quality Control Quantitative Precipitaton Estimation Inter-comparison Project\" (RQQI) meeting anymore. We would like to apologize for the deviation from the original announcement. However, we still have more than enough exciting stuff to address in the course. \r\n\r\n### Registration \r\nRegister at the [ERAD Short Course page](http://erad2016.org/short-courses/) for *Short Course 1*. A fee of 50 EURO will be charged including luch and coffee breaks. Beware that the maximum number of participants is limited to 30.\r\n\r\n### List of tutors\r\n- Crisologo, Irene (University of Potsdam, Germany)\r\n- Heistermann, Maik (University of Potsdam, Germany)\r\n- Henja, Anders (HENJAB, Sweden)\r\n- Michelson, Daniel B. (Environment and Climate Change Canada)\r\n\r\n### Things you need to prepare\r\nParticipants need to bring their own notebook. All you need to do is to install VirtualBox and import the Virtual Machine for the course. Please see http://openradar.github.io for detailed instructions. However, we will send around an e-Mail with instructions to the registered participants, too.  \r\n\r\n### Preliminary course program\r\n| Time         | Activity                                                 |\r\n| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n|09:00 - 09:30 | Introduction to radar community software (Maik)          |\r\n|09:30 - 09:45 | How to use the virtual machine?
