  "body": "### Welcome to the ERAD 2016 short course on community radar software\r\nThis course will take place on October 9th 2016, right before the ERAD 2016 conference. We will introduce the participants to community software packages designed for radar data processing, mainly [BALTRAD](http://git.baltrad.eu/) and [wradlib](http://wradlib.github.io/wradlib-docs). \r\n\r\nThese tools can be controlled by using Python, so we'll feature a quick intro to the Python programming language, and endow participants with the basics of how to contribute to community software. For the course, we will provide a [platform-independent virtual machine](http://openradar.github.com) that contains all the required software, data, and course materials.\r\n\r\n> *Please note:* We had to slightly adjust the course contents in comparison to the original announcement \r\n> (see the [course program](#course-program) below). We will not provide in-depth coverage of the \r\n> [Py-ART](http://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/) package, although we'll feature a quick background. \r\n> Furthermore, the link to the \"WMO Radar Quality Control Quantitative Precipitaton\r\n> Estimation Inter-comparison Project\" (RQQI) was cancelled. \r\n\r\n### Registration \r\nRegister at the [ERAD Short Course page](http://erad2016.org/short-courses/) for *Short Course 1*. A fee of 50 EURO will be charged including luch and coffee breaks. Beware that the maximum number of participants is limited to 30.\r\n\r\n### List of tutors\r\n- Crisologo, Irene (University of Potsdam, Germany)\r\n- Heistermann, Maik (University of Potsdam, Germany)\r\n- Michelson, Daniel B. (Environment and Climate Change Canada)\r\n\r\n### Things you need to prepare\r\nParticipants need to bring their own notebook. All you need to do is to install VirtualBox and import the Virtual Machine for the course. Please see http://openradar.github.io for detailed instructions, but, in time, we will also send around an e-Mail to the registered participants.  \r\n\r\n### Course program\r\n| Time         | Activity                                           |\r\n| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |\r\n|09:00 - 09:30 | Community weather radar software (Maik)            |\r\n|09:30 - 09:45 | The course platform: a virtual machine (Maik)      |\r\n|09:45 - 10:30 | Community software development basics (Daniel)     |\r\n|10:30 - 10:45 | *Coffee break*                                     |\r\n|10:45 - 11:15 | A quick start to scientific Python (Maik)          |\r\n|11:15 - 12:30 | Hands on wradlib (Maik)                            |\r\n|12:30 - 13:45 | *Lunch break*                                      |\r\n|13:45 - 15:30 | Hands on BALTRAD (Daniel)                          |\r\n|15:30 - 16:00 | *Coffee break*                                     |\r\n|16:00 - 16:45 | Open slot for further exploration (all)            |\r\n|16:45 - 17:00 | Wrap-up and evaluation (all)                       |\r\n  \r\n",
