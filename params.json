{"name":"ERAD 2016 Open Software Course","tagline":"All you need to know about the upcoming short course on community radar software at ERAD 2016","body":"### Welcome to the ERAD 2016 short course on community radar software\r\nThis course will take place on October 9th 2016, right before the ERAD 2016 conference. We will introduce the participants to community software packages designed for radar data processing, mainly Py-ART, BALTRAD, and wradlib. \r\n\r\nThese tools can be controlled by using Python, so we'll feature a quick intro to the Python programming language, and endow participants with the basics of how to contribute to community software. For the course, we will provide a [platform-independent virtual machine](http://openradar.github.com) that contains all the required software, data and other course materials.\r\n\r\n### Registration \r\nWatch the [ERAD Short Course page](http://erad2016.org/short-courses/) for course registration. Beware that the maximum number of participants is limited to 30.\r\n\r\n### Preliminary list of tutors (confirmed and solicited)\r\n- Collis, Scott (Argonne National Laboratory, USA)\r\n- Crisologo, Irene (University of Potsdam, Germany)\r\n- Heistermann, Maik (University of Potsdam, Germany)\r\n- Helmus, Jonathan J. (Argonne National Laboratory, USA)\r\n- Henja, Anders (HENJAB, Sweden)\r\n- Michelson, Daniel B. (Environment and Climate Change Canada)\r\n- Muehlbauer, Kai (University of Bonn, Germany)\r\n- ...?\r\n\r\n### Things you need to prepare\r\nParticipants need to bring their own notebook. All you need to do is to install VirtualBox and import the Virtual Machine for the course. Please see http://openradar.github.io for detailed instructions.   \r\n\r\n### Link to RQQI\r\nThis course will be held in parallel to a meeting of the \"WMO Radar Quality Control Quantitative Precipitaton Estimation Inter-comparison Project\" (RQQI). The potential for synergies between RQQI and community software development is obvious. In order to enhance exchange between both events, we will have joint introductory and synthesis sessions.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
